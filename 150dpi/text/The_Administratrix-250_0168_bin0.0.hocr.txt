“Mary, you ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Iola,
sternly. “You said only yesterday that of all things you
despised a married flirt most.”
« Who's flirting ?”
“ You are.”
“ Tola Fleming!”
“TI say you are flirting. You may not see it, but I do.

green alfalfa field. You can leave the door open and listen,
or V'll tell you the yarn after I get possession of it, which-
ever you prefer. Ta, ta.”

Gus lay upon the grass plat, his broad hat shading his

Bill sat astride a log, eutting figures in its bark. Hen Hall
and Broncho Charlie stood near the water’s edge, throwing
