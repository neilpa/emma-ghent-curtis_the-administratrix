80 MANY RIATAS ARE THROW.
Mary found the Chellis mansion commodious in size and
elegant in furnishings. The great parlor, with its heavy
velvet carpet that deadened her footfalls, was filled with the
most elegant upholstered contrivances for the encouragement

At the windows the light came in softly, mellowed by pass-

Jim? My inequality in the fight? Does she want to show
me that that which astonishes me is old and crude to her?
