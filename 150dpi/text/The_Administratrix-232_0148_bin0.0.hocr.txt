THE COWBOY AS ROMANCER.
In the frenzy of brain-racking fever,
Like the mad triummvir of old,
He would mart the vast world for a womar
‘And count it most happily sold,
So adown a darksome tunnel
He bore his chance-won fair.
While his three companions followed
To the hermit’s cell of prayer.
And here he told his story
‘And pleaded the lover's plea—
He would barter a year of possession
For all eternity.
‘And in his deep despairing
He wafted a prayer above,
That clan and caste might pass from earth,
And nauglit remain save love.
But the hermit uttered remonstrance,
And bade King consider well,
‘That before there could be a just union
The lady her mind must tell.
‘The lady recovered her senses, ‘eb,
with gasping and weary si
Told her lover that her relnetanee
‘Must hold forever and aye.
But before King reluctantly freed her
He grasped her resisting hand,
‘And swore the vows of a husband—
Then turned and fled from the band.
As he left them all standing in wonder
‘At his wild, despairing flight,
He turned about and shouted
‘To that lady of beanty and light:—
“To the Pan Handle wild Iam going
To lash out my aimless life—
‘The heartwrecked, despairing husband
‘Who can claim no woman as wife.
And remember, cruel lady,
When friends prove false and cold,
‘That the love of the one you are scorning
Will never in life grow old.”
