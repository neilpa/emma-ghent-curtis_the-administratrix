THE ADMINISTRATRIX.
SADDLE DREAMS.
‘To him who asks of the hill breeze
The blessings of rest and of health,
A saddle and light stepping broncho
Become the completeness of wé
Over the wild hills I gallop
Through the waning afternoon,
‘And regret the shades of evening,
‘As they gather all too soon.
‘The soul can but feebly imagine
‘The seclusion the wild range hath,
For not even a cowboy’s sombrero,
Has shadowed my rock, beset path.
T have threaded the gloomy canon
‘With its driftwood legends of flood,
‘Where the stealthy and merciless puma
Leaves his trail bright red with blood.
‘At my broncho’s resounding footsteps,
The wild cat starts from her lair,
While beating the clouds above me
The eagle hangs in mid air.
Lam all alone with nature,
‘And while I muse on her charms,
She steals away my senses,
And I dream within her arms.
‘The goddess of mountain has vanished
With her pinon and cedar decked train
And mounted on snow-white palfrey,
defy the Armada of Spain.
‘And then as I ride in triumph,
Through city, through hamlet and tow
L press my hand to my forehead,
"To lighten a jewel decked crown.
Next I sit in the groves of old Athens-
To the council is Pericles gone—
Thave given to him of my wisdom,
‘My eloquence burns on his tongue.
Then quickly the scene all changess
Beside me the wild sea roars;
bind on the arms of my Hector
‘And send him away to the wars;
And while my own tears are falling,
T soothe the boy at my knee;
But chide that the guilty Paris
Refuse to set false Helen free.
‘Then on my throne at Palmyra
Ibid my warrior braves
Prepare for the Roman Legions
‘My fertile plains for graves.
