158 THK ADMINISTRATRIX,
To the dream one I love I forever will cling;
‘There's a light in his eye that assures me of truth;
1 will clasp his strong hand through the long, happy years,
And the love of my age be the love of my youth:
My dream love is feariess in heart and in deed,
In the cause of all justice stern danger he braves;
His strength is the strength of the storm-tested oak,
‘And the réle that he plays is the hero who saves.
Gus Waite was standing by the piano during this song
and it is the opinion of many who were present that he in-
formed Iola that he would like her to bear well in mind
the fact that he was a vaquero; but this is not substantiated
and is after all, only an opinion. Penobscot Bill was next
called upon. Bill denied the authorship of his song, but his
denial like many other, was confession itself. In a voice
well-nigh shaming a fog horn he sang:
Tue Cownoy’s WAIL.
“ Pl tell you alll the reason
can’t git the gal I choose;
‘She's dead gone on a little tenderfoot dude,
And that gives me the blues.
0, if I had a lasso,
Some two miles long or more,
Td choke that dude till his sneakin’ soul,
Histed out fer the evergreen shore.
‘The next time he comes prowlin’
‘And grazin’ round my range,
If his death beller does not shake these bills,
It’s goin’ to be strange.
Yl drop him where I find him,
But his hide won’t be for sale;
@ warnin’ to dudes and tenderfeet
It will hang on a cottonwood rail.””
To say that Bill was applauded would but faintly sum uj
the facts. He was so vehemently urged to favor the crow:
again that he ‘iously consented; and after a prefatory
shake of his curls sang a long ballad concerning a gentleman
of freebooting proclivities who secluded himself in a chimney
and eventually had the misfortune to fall down into the fire
and narrowly escape roasting. Kid then sang,
Tue MestTezo’s SERENADE.
Pray thee listen, lady mine,
While the stars so sweetly shine;
Ere the shadows in the hills, —
