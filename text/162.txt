THE COWBOY AS A POET. 155
Their voices are more soft and low, than notes of woodland birds;
And only elfin ears make out, their sweet and hopeful words,
But man may hear the rustle soft, of their tuneful silvery leaves,
That is far more sweet than the breath of June, mid yellow harvest
sheaves.
Sway on bright leaves from your slender stalks, through the scented
evening air;
Sing courage to despairing hearts, speak comfort everywhere;
Bid haste the day of world-wide peace, of which we fondly dream,
When through the night of gloom and woe, the stars of hope shall
gleam.
Onur lives are like these rolling hills, that tower to the sky,
We have our hours of warmth and light, when fortune’s sun rides
ig.
But when arrives the darkened hour, which the fates to each life
ng:
Let us bide some voice within us wake, and like the Aspens, sing.”
Since Bella had composed this herself, she was overwhelmed
‘ith congratulations from all save Penobscot Bill. Bill of
ourse had been accustomed to such fine poetry and superior
ausic “back yonder” that he did not become effusive. Gus
Vaite, sitting next, sang in very good tone to Iola’s accom-
animent, a song of which he modestly admitted himself to
e author :
RICH, OR POOR.
The rich man drives his matched bays out
In the yellow afternoon ;
In December he has hothouse fruit—
He eats ice-cream in June.
He feels himself a mighty lord,
But listen to what I say;
There’s a time when the poor man his vantage feels,
And that’s on tax-paying day.
The rich man gloats o’er his houses and lands,
And his barns well filled with grain;
With pride he notes his sleek, fat stock—
He is free from poverty’s chain.
He smiles in happy security,
But my voice with wisdom rings—
The poor man has far less to lose
When the cyclone loudly sings.
The rich man owns large tracts in town,
Well covered with dwellings and stores,
That rise to the clouds in splendor superb,
In the glory of nine or ten floors.
