A LAST GLIMPSE.
their voices died away the two girls began, wit
ancholy voices, to sing,
THE COWBOY’S LONE GRAVE.
Far up in the mountains, far down on the plains,
On the lonely frontier where no kindly eye weeps;
Where the sound waves vibrate at the cry of the wol
There is many a mound where the lone cowboy slee
But though dense be the pinons,
And tall be the pines,
And close be the aspens whose slender tops wave;
Though wild be the mountains—
Deserted the plains—
The dear God knows the place of the cowboy’s lone
The howling coyote and the shrill crying eagle
Disturb not his rest as he slumbers for aye;
His faults and his virtues and name are forgotten,
But over his mound sorrow-laden winds sigh.
And though dense be the pinons
And tall be the pines,
And close be the aspens whose slender tops wave;
Though wild be the mountains, —
Deserted the plains — .
The dear God knows the place of the cowboy’s lone
He marched in the van of a home-hunting people,
His blood quenched the fires of the fierce border fray
Let his evils be sunk in the evils he strangled
And his record of valor pass never away,
And though dense be the pinons,
And tall be the pines,
And close be the aspens whose slender tops wave;
Though wild be the mountains—
Deserted the plains—
The dear God knows the place of the cowboy’s lone
