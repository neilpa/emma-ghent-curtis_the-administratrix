98 THE ADMINISTRATRIX.
“0, you needn't go to performin’ that way, gal. I’m
about three times as old as you are, and about four times as
ugly, and that’s why I think my judgment is about seven
times better nor yourn. ‘Three and four is seven, you know.
I think that when you're all safely married to Jim that you'll
thank me for these little suggestions. You’re kinder sickly,
and Jim’s mighty able to take care of you.”
“But you wouldn’t have me marry him for that reason
alone, Mr. Hogan ?”
“Tf youmarry Jim, it won’tbe for that reason alone. I’ve
been watchin’ things drift fer some time. Jim ain’t slidin’
towards you, while you’re standin’ stock still. You're
movin’ too.”
Mary colored deeply, but could not repress a smile. We
do not'so much mind being taken at a disadvantage, if the
work is skillfully done. She stood watching the pleasant
old lady knitting, until a new thought struck her. ‘Then she
took a chair, and said:
“Mr. Hogan, why have you quit making light of Mr.
Lancaster ?
“Didn't want to waste my ammunition, gal. I know’d
you was safe from Stan Lancaster long ’fore youdid. When-
ever a gal is talkin’ to a feller with her eyes and thoughts
on some one else, and yawns when he jest barely gets out-
side the door, stead of lookin’ like everything of interest to
her was jest swallered up in an earthquake, she’s mighty
safe. I didn’t care fer Stan comin’ here, ’cause soon as I saw
he wasn’t goin’ to bag the game I thort I’d kinder enjoy his
disapp’intment. You see Stan makes his brags that he’s
left a good many gals sore-hearted. If it’s so, I’ve kinder
got my opinion as to how much sense they had; but never-
theless, I don’t mind seein’ him punished fer blowin’.”
‘The subject was allowed to drop. Mary was in such high
anticipation of to-morrow’s joys, that her sleep was imper-
fect, and troubled with dreams. She was dressed and wait-
ing long before the appointed time for Amy to appear.
