THE ROUNDUP.
‘Tu blue-eyed, buckskin-shirted vaquero rode through the
little settlement, pausing for some reason at the house
situated at the highest limit of tho scattered group. He
then turned his broncho again toward the higher country,
and rode at a slow pace to a level park about five miles above
the last farm house. Upon a level spot on this park, near
the low bank of a very tiny stream, lounged, sat and lay a group
of men of all sizes and nearly all ages. A dozen or so ponies
stood grazing about. Some of these were saddled and bridled,
doing their best to get a supper of gramma grass in spite of
the forbidding bit. Some had been unsaddled and tethered.
Some, more beloved perhaps than the others, were being
caressed and fed lump sugar by their masters. Two men
lay beside a huge fire with their heads upon saddles, and
their flushed, drowsy faces indicating a half sleep; they did
not choose the vicinity of the fire Because they were cold
—the weather was exceedingly pleasant—they had come in
hungry after a long ride, and they wanted to catch the aroma
of the preparing supper and badger the cook. They half
dozed from time to time, waking only to brush the snapping
juniper coals off of their shirts and chaparejos,* and to hurry
up the cook. ‘The latter all-important personage stood over
the fire, stirring a huge caldron of coffee with a big iron
spoon, and frequently lifting the cover off a similar caldron
filled with beans. He flourished the spoon with which he
had stirred the coffee, and told one of his eager watchers
that if he thought he could “ hurry up the chuck any faster
than he was doing, to come and take the job or else shut
up. The watcher quieted. He was a tail, athletic, splen-
didly built man of some twenty-eight or twenty-nine years.
His face was singularly handsome. He raised toa sitting
posture ae the cook said to him in s rather sharp tone:
* Usually abbreviated to “chaps” ; pronounced “haps.”
