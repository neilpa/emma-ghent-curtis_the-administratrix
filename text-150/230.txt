THE COWBOY AS ROMANCER,
Of the skins of their benefactors
‘They made garments of cut most rare;
And clothed themselves in bearskin
So that their skin be not bare.
And the short and thick-set gentleman,
Whose name was Jonathan Jones,
Informed the beautiful lady,
That for lamps they used the bon
With the cavities filled with bear's oll,
And wicks from their own old clothes,
‘Mr. Jones explained that the light thus
‘A goodly distance shows.
‘The entire wealth of the cavern,
‘Was an outcropping coal bed found,
A vein of gold and a living brook,
‘And the bears that bi-yearly came roum
Then Jonathan Jones led the lady
Past the brook with its muflled roar,
To where earnestly playing seven-up
Sat three of this wonderful four.
They were seated on large, smooth boul
Their table a huge round stone.
‘They leaped up at sight of the lady,
Almost as if reason had flown.
But Jonathan Jones to the rescue
Explained her presence there;
And stated that she was not running,
From an evil-terapered bear.
"They very politely welcomed
ais addition to their bands
ey called for a new de: around,
And bade her take a hand.
THE INTERVIEW.
(Penobscot Bill.)
‘The handsome and stately King,
With locks like a raven’s wing,
Proposed the very first thing,
‘That the crowd at large form a ring,
And let him and Mister Jones fight,
With all their concentrated might,
‘To see which had the best right
To this creature of beauty and light.
For the lady had captured King’s hi
Old Cupid had sent forth a dak cant
That gave him a terrible start,
And left a most horrible smart,
That could only be cured by the bliss,
‘That this most bewitching young miss,
Could impart in a warm bridal Kise,
King admitted the truth of all this,
