304 THE ADMINISTRATRIX.
awoke with a start. On the street in Milroy City, where
the greatest excitement concerning the affair prevailed, they
did not carry their old-time fearless, self-respectinglook. ‘They
could not but feel that the people who looked in their faces
suspected them as murderers. This was a phase of the ques-
tion they had not previously thought upon, It was more
pleasant to contemplate a coming adventure than to remem-
ber a past murder. Then they remembered now, how often
Jim had divided his water supply with them, and how Stanley
Lancaster had generally found some use for all his waste water
instead of letting it come down the ditch to swell their por-

shedding the light of their financial and social prestige upon
them, had not directed any dollars into their pockets. ‘They
began to think that if Jim actually was guilty it was a
pity. But in their conversation with each other they still
held that they were right. No man wants his confederate
to perceive that he is weakening. In general conversation
they refused, of course, to acknowledge the part they had
taken, but openly justified the deed. Their wives helped
matters along by insinuating against Mary’s character.

things that were said about her at the time of her marriage
were true. They had always suspected, etc., etc. This stab
is always ready for the attractive woman the instant her
household is shrouded in misfortune. No other is sufficient.
When we wish to smirch a man, we accuse him of having
taken from some other creature something of ‘value; virtue ?
No, a man is not injured in reputation by having stolen
virtue. He must take money or life. When we wish to
smirch a woman we accuse her of having suffered the loss of
something; money or life? No, the loss of these will not
pollute her. It is virtue that must have been stolen from
er.
