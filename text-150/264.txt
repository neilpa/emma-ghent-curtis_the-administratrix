RAISIN’ THUNDER. 267
of the sitting-room party a perfect pandemonium of deafenin,
sounds. Groans, yells, shrieks, howls, and curses, followe
each other in quick succession; then came a sound as if a
dozen men, mingled with boot-jacks, chairs, boxes, and old
shoes, were running, rolling, falling, and tumbling down-
stairs, with speed the only thing in view. The stair door
burst open, and Lat Jennings, white as a sheet, half-leaped,
half-fell into the sitting-room. His hair and clothes bore
evidence of rough usage, and playing cards fell in showers

Mary can be getting lint and bandages ready,” and Jim
and Kid started for the door.
But just then Hen returned. He was still white and
angry. Without noticing Jim, he said directly to Mary .
“Vm ashamed, Missns, of raisin’ sech a racket in’ your
house; but I’ve got grievance enough to make me run them
two coyotes clear off the range.”
“ Why, what had the boys done?”
“ Well, Missus, you know that little Bible that I’ve got,
that I told you belonged to one as was dear to me?”
“Yes; I remember it well.”
