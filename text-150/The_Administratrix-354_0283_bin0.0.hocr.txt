THE WIDOW'S DREAM,
Isat by an open casement
Looking out on the desolate night;
It was days since the soul of my life mat
Had taken its Heavenward flight.
At the bright, mocking stars I sat gazing
‘As they sailed o'er the blue ether deep;
Till my unquiet spirit rested
In the crad’ling arms of sleep.
"Then I threw off my human framework,
And into the ether above,
Sailing high amid mystical cloud banks,
Lrose a snow white dove;
‘And though I felt the full power
Of a fresh, unwearied wing,
My heart go heavily widowed
Clogged my voice when my bird throat w
‘The only sounds I could utter
‘Were piercing, discordant cries;
But Iheard from a cloudlet near me
An answering call arise
fore I could still my wailing—
For I knew that voice full well—
‘A sound of rustling plumage
‘On my fevered senses fell.
And then a soft feathered pinion
Gave my neck a half embrace,
A beak sought mine for an instant
Then I floated alone in space.
I knew that my spirit husband
Had given thai pressure and kiss;
That God for one mortal moment
Had granted me immortal bliss.
Throughout the on-coming ages
Though I live ten thousand years,
‘The caress of that soft pressing pinion
‘Will check my anguished tears.
No more will I be a weak woman
Bewailing my sorrow in sighs;
I will gird on the strength of a giant,
Like a genie my power shall arise.
Like the tiger in wild Hindu jungle
That stealthily tracks his prey,
I will hunt the merciless hunters,
Who stole my mate away.
The prejudiced wights who despoiled me
I will drive "neath the chastening rod;
‘And leave the result of my quarrel
To the mercy and justice of God.
