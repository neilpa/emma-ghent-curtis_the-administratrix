This effort having been roundly applauded, Bella Martin,
tho sat next, went to the piano, played an unostentatious
ccompaniment, and sang in a sweet, clear voice:
THE SONG OF THE QUAKING ASPENS.
“Now overhead the god of day, his chariot race has done;
His banners flaunting in the West proclaim the goal is won;
"The mountains darken as he flees, "neath night’s advancing wing,
And rustling in the evening air, the quaking Aspens sing.
Far up from the haunts of toil and strife, high over the homes of
‘men,
‘Their white tranks sway in the lightest breeze, of the grassy moun-
tain glen;
As the zepkiyre ‘softly clasp their leaves, there breathes a sweet
refrain,
n tones that hint of joy and hope, and banish care and pain.
