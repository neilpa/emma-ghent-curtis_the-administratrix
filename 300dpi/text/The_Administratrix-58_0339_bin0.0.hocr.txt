THE MYSTERIES OF COWBOYISM, 51
“ Now, there’s another word—range; you call the moun-
tains the range, and yet you talk about the feed on the
range being short. Most of the cattle seem to run on the—
what you call the parks.”
“ Yes; the parks and valleys form the cattle range: the
cattle range over them.”
“Oh, yes. But what time is it? It must be nearly time
for me to go back to the camp.”
“Tt’s thirty-five minutes after three.”
“Well, I must go; and I’ve learned a great deal, Mr.
Madnau.”
“ Well, I’m glad you have. And Miss Fleming, the next
time I see you, you must tell me all about your trade—school
teachin’.” This last was said with a provoking smile that
showed Jim’s teeth, and exasperated Mary fearfully, telling
her plainer than any words could have done, that she had
been presumptuous and inquisitive. “I'd better ride back
to camp with you,” headded. “ Kate will behave herself better
if I’m where I can speak to her.”
No word was spoken as they rode to the group; not until
Mrs. Hogan hailed Mary from beneath her sun umbrella, was
the silence broken.
“J was just thinking it was time to go,” said the old lady.
And Mary struck her broad-brimmed straw hat violently on
the top to drive it lower down over her face, and hide the
angry surging color. She was more than ever resolved to
hate Jim Madnau. Never before had such a feeling of resist-
ance raged within her. There was no fate so horrible that
for the moment she would not have visited upon him. For
him, in his serene and conscious superiority of strength, and
for all she knew, intelligence, to stoop from his manhood to
make light ofa woman! So filled was her mind with resent-
ment, that the image of the splendid Lancaster was for the
time swept away. She gave Madnau a good-night from lips
that trembled with rage, and without assistance from any
one, climbed into the spring-wagon.
