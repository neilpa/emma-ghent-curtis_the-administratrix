This was along speech for Gus to make, but it had the
effect of lightening Kid’s gloom.
CHAPTER XLV.
THE HISTORY OF A NIGHT,
Aveust and September had gone. The early days of
October were come. The roundup had again been delayed
but now it was at hand. On the morrow it would begin. —
Mose had become such a favorite with his co-workers that
no one of them would have denied him any reasonable re-
quest. They were secretly jealous of each other. They
watched him out of sight when he rode away in the morn-
ing, and waved their hats to greet him when he came in at
night. He was the babe of their camp, and they often found
themselves moving to caress him. Unasked, they told him
their hopes and fears and doubts. He gave sympathy, and
then such as had crimes to confess, confessed them. We
know not how weak we are until the magnetism of the beau-
tiful and the charming has touched us. Their faith in him
was infinite. They were glad that his previous love affair
kept him away from the ladies down in the settlements.
He was theirs; and they would have hated a woman who
would have attracted him. His songs were the opera; his
stories, the literary world; his recitations, the theatre; and
his feats of horsemanship, the arena. Every man who had
anything of importance to tell, told Mose; every man who
learned a new card trick, taught it to Mose; every man who
had money to lend, pressed it upon Mose. Should not they
themselves have known that such favor is impossible between
members of the same sex? His very manner softened and
tamed them. He could be a tyrant when aroused, and when
he became such the men quailed before him. But he was
oftener the petted and childish favorite. He looked annoyed
at their profanity, and sneered when they told questionable
stories. His sneer was not without effect; for that which
borders on contempt and touches ridicule is often more
potent than reason. In his efforts for good he was always
seconded by Rocky Mountain Bill.
