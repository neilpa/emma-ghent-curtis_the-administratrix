THE ADMINISTRATRLX.
The lady indignantly said
That a cowboy she never would wed;
Jealous Jones then declared that her head,
Was level; and he would stand by her till dead.
Then King told the lady he’d give her one chance
To escape being party to his life romance;
They would play seven-up. If she won she might dam
In the joy of her freedom. But if he, perchance,
Were winner, his life she must share;
They would speedily pair:
And he’d make her aware,
He had plenty of gold of a fineness most rare.
They would rush past the bears with their fierce hungr
And build them a dwelling in some thriving town,
Far away from the range of the bears huge and brown.
They played, and he won. In a swoon she sank dow!
THE RECLUSE.
(Hen Hall.)
It chanced that in a tunnel near,
Unknown to all save King,
There dwelt a pious hermit
Who noted Fall nor Spring,
But lived in contemplation
Of the sins and woes of man,
And in mourning the injustice deep
That has reigned since time began.
In the vaquero’s heart-battle
His thought to the hermit turned—
He would hasten and ask if unholy
Was his passion flame that burned.
Then he stooped o’er his chance-won lady,
And lifting her slender form,
He pressed her head where his warring heart
Was beating its maiden storm.
As his brain reeled in contemplation
Of the wealth within his arms,
With shouts to Heaven he vowed to keep
Her from Earth’s ten thousand harms,
He owned himself coarse and unholy
Beside this woman divine;
But never had he felt such strength
To combat fate malign.
In the throes of a new-born
That links Earth with the skies,
Love’s twenty thousand voices
He felt in his heart arise.
All Earth became a vast cavern
Peopled by these alone;
There was left a single ambition
A single field to be won.
