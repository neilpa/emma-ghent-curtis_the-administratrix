THE COWBOY AS A POET.
THE RANGE CALVES.
Our Saviour bade us feed and shelter
The children he counted so dear,
But who will feed the little range calves
When the range is bare and drear ?
The range calves, the range calves,
The hungry little range calves;
O, who will feed the range calves,
When the range is bare and drear ?
When chill December’s heavy skies
Throw down their weight of snow;
And sweep the range with their icy breath,
Where shall the range calves go ?
The range calves, the ranges calves,
The little shiv’ring range calves;
O, who will shelter the range calves,
Away from December’s snow.
Ere the flowers of spring bloom forth again,
Thousands of them will lie,
Close beside mothers who fought in vain,
’Gainst the sky’s inclemency.
The range calves, the range calves,
The little stiffened range calves,
But they’ll feel no more hunger and shiver no !
At the sky’s inclemency.
came Iola, who sang :
Tue Sone OF THE MOUNTAIN MAID.
I love these wild mountains so rocky and steep,
The gloom of the gorge, the deep blue of the sky
T love the dark river that lashes its wall—
I sing to the star that shine softly on high.
But the sweets of old nature my heart cannot fill
I am lone as I gaze on the river’s mad wave;
I hunger to taste the fond love of my kind;
May the love that I love be a vaquero brave.
I love the grand storm as it stretches afar,
When the peals of its thunder roll deep in the ni
When the lightning illumes with its weird, spect
And the storm king rules all with his power and
But e’en while the thunder is rolling apace,
And while the fierce winds all relentlessly rave,
I send out my prayer on the wings of the storm,
That the love I shall love be a vaquero brave,
