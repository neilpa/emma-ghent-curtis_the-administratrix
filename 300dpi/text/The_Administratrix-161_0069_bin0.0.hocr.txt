So mother, dear mother, though you love me well I know,

This effort having been roundly applauded, Bella Martin,
‘ho sat next, went to the piano, played an unostentatious
scompaniment, and sang in a sweet, clear voice :
THE SONG OF THE QUAKING ASPENS.
‘Now overhead the god of day, his chariot race has done;
His banners flaunting in the West proclaim the goal is won;
The mountains darken as he flees, neath night’s advancing
And rustling in the evening air, the quaking Aspens sing.
Far up from the haunts of toil and strife, high over the homes of
Their white tranks sway in the lightest breeze, of the grassy moun-
As the zene ‘softly clasp their leaves, there breathes a sweet
n tones that hint of joy and hope, and banish care and pain.
