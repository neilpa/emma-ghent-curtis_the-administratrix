THE COWBOY AS ROMANCER.
In the frenzy of brain-racking fever,
Like the mad triumvir of old,
He would mart the vast world for a woma
And count it most happily sold.
So adown a darksome tunnel
He bore his chance-won fair.
While his three companions followed
To the hermit’s cell of prayer.
And here he told his story
And pleaded the lover’s plea—
He would barter a year of possession
For all eternity.
And in his deep despairing
He wafted a prayer above,
That clan and caste might pass from earth
And nauglit remain save love.
But the hermit uttered remonstrance,
And bade King consider well,
That before there could be a just union
The lady her mind must tell.
The lady recovered her senses,
And with gasping and weary sigh,
Told her lover that her reluctance
Must hold forever and aye.
But before King reluctantly freed her
He grasped her resisting hand,
And swore the vows of a husband—
Then turned and fled from the band.
As he left them all standing in wonder
At his wild, despairing flight,
He turned about and shouted
To that lady of beauty and light:—
“To the Pan Handle wild I am going
To lash out my aimless life—
The heartwrecked, despairing husband
Who can claim no woman as wife.
And remember, cruel lady,
When friends prove false and cold,
That the love of the one you are scorning
Will never in life grow old.”
CoNCLUSION.

1e lady saw King speeding out of her sight
that the wall lamps were losing their light
ed that. the man whom she rudely had spu
J of her days into romance have turned.

1 she remembered the strength of his arms
igh of Hellenic not a word he could speak
rasily carried the weg of her Greek.
