and answered them. One of these answers was addressed to
Joshua Hogan, the other to Iola Fleming. They were dropped
in the outside box at a time when there were no on-lookers.
Mose accomplished the wonderful feat of getting home the
same day he started away. ‘The men crowded eagerly round
him, for two large bundles were tied to his saddle.
“What you got there, Mose ?” eagerly demanded Griff
Henry.
“ The collection you fellows took up for my benefit.”
Mose unstrapped the bundles and carried them into the
house. When they were opened they proved themselves
worthy the excitement they had created. An illustrated
history of the United States, a splendidly bound copy of
Victor Hugo’s Les Miserables, Longfellow’s and Whittier’s
poems, and Uncle Tom’s Cabin; then in paper bindings,
Middlemarch, Daniel Deronda, Adam Bede, David Copper-
field, Ivanhoe, Kenilworth, Eugene Aram and Vanity Fair.
The men were much delighted. We may allow our surround-
ings to crowd away our books, but the sight of them is as
the sight of long separated friends. For their sake we shake
off our coarseness, and show ourselves at our best. The
good that is in us struggles forward to meet them; we would,
if possible, keep our darker side turned away.
The excitement caused ‘by these books’ was long-lived.
There had been books at the Circle Bar before, but they
were for the most part such as half disgusted those who
eagerly read them; they left no desire for better thoughts
and cleaner lives. They had more the effect of unwhole-
some stimulants, than of pleasing and nourishing mental food
that would forever strengthen and sustain. The discussions
over the new books were not carried on in the most correct
and staid language, but even the authors themselves would
have been pleased to listen.
