“ Mary, you ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Iola,
sternly. “You said only yesterday that of all things you
despised a married flirt most.”
“ Who’s flirting ?”
“ You are.”
“ Tola Fleming

and we’ll miss the sight of his red shirt lighting up the
green alfalfa field. You can leave the door open and listen,
or I'll tell you the yarn after I get possession of it, which-
ever you prefer. Ta, ta.”

Bill sat astride a log, cutting figures in its bark. Hen Hall
and Broncho Charlie stood near the water’s edge, throwing
