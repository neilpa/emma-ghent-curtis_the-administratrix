84 THE ADMINISTRATRIA.
been tuck in again. I’m glad the machine’s all right.
But how did you like Jim?”
“QO, very well; I liked him better than the man that was
with him.”
“ Who was that ?”
6 Mr, Lancaster, I think was the name.”
“Yes, and your decision shows you’ve got good sense.
Jim’s worth a state full of Stan Lancasters. Jim’s not
home for good, I reckon.”
“QO, no; he just came—for some clothes, I believe.” Then
she colored; the idea of her having constructed that shirt
for Jim Madnau. Then she mentally complimented herself
upon her judgment of people and ate her supper in a happy
mood; then she helped with the dishes, and afterward chat-
ted with the old people until half-past eight. She did not
retire at once upon entering her room, she lighted her lamp
and once more turned to the pages of her diary. She wrote:
“ Something tells me that to-day I have met the man who
is to share my fortunes. I have formed several ideals but
none were so splendid as he. What more is there to be de-
sired ? He has wealth, youth, beauty, and manliness of the
loftiest order. I already feel how easy it will be to love
him. And he has never loved another—has seldom even
kept company with a lady. It is quite plain that he admires
me. If this is to be my fate, I believe that it can only bea
happy one. There is but one thing to fear; I dread lest in
some way I arouse the jealousy and anger of that other
man. I fear him. When he looks at me he makes me trem-
ble. I would willingly see the jealous interloper suffer, if
only he does not do me some fearful injury in return. I
dread him; he is in my thoughts and I can not tell why, as
I would gladly cease thinking of him. Never before have I
felt the resentment I felt to-night.”
