CHAPTER VI,
PROGRESS,
Ir was late in the afternoon of the next Monday. Mary,
“Miss Fleming” in the school-room, bent over the last
slate. The spelling lesson was done with and the grade
figures were carrying pride or dismay to the hearts of the
spellers. On this occasion there was a large percentage of
pride, for the lesson had been well prepared. The satisfied
look upon the faces of both pupils and teacher augured this.
The latter wrote “100 ” upon the last slate, and laid it upon
its owner’s desk. Then she stepped to the area in front of
the pupils’ seats. She was pleasant to look upon in her neat
gingham dress, with her dark hair in a little crown on her
head and in ringlets over her brow. She raised one hand,
and a smile broke over her face.
** All who have learned something new to-day, raise hands,”
she said. A score of hands of all descriptions and shades
went up.
“What have you learned, Tommy ? ” to a ten year old son
of big Bill Coffroth.
“T’ve learned that the world goes round the sun once a
year,” exclaimed Tommy, as he bobbed out of bis seat.
“ And Maggie?” to Maggie Haskins.
“T’ve learned that it takes from four and one half to five
bushels of wheat to make a bar’! of flour.”
“A barrel, Maggie.”
“O, yes; a barrel of flour.”
“ And Eddy?” to little Eddy White, aged six.
“T’ve learned that two rabbits and two rabbits are four
rabbits ; but that two rabbits and two cats are just two
rabbits and two cats.”
“Very good. And Florence?” toa girl aged fifteen.
‘When a pitcher of very cold water is placed in a warm
room, the outside of the pitcher is soon covered with moist-
ure. I have learned that the cold surface of the pitcher
causes condensation of the surrounding air, causing it to leave
a large portion of its moisture upon the vessel,”
